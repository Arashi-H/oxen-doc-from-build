\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Tag types that are used (via inheritance) to set rpc endpoint properties. 

Specifies that the R\+PC call is public (i.\+e. available through restricted rpc). If this is {\itshape not} inherited from then the command is restricted (i.\+e. only available to admins). For L\+MQ, \mbox{\hyperlink{structcryptonote_1_1rpc_1_1PUBLIC}{P\+U\+B\+L\+IC}} commands are available at {\ttfamily rpc.\+command} (versus non-\/\+P\+U\+B\+L\+IC ones at {\ttfamily admin.\+command}). 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
src/rpc/common/\mbox{\hyperlink{command__decorators_8h}{command\+\_\+decorators.\+h}}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
