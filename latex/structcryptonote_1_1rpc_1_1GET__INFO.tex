\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Retrieve general information about the state of the node and the network.

Inputs\+: none.

Output values available from a public R\+PC endpoint\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily status} General R\+PC status string. {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+O\+K\char`\"{}} means everything looks good.
\item {\ttfamily height} Current length of longest chain known to daemon.
\item {\ttfamily target\+\_\+height} The height of the next block in the chain.
\item {\ttfamily immutable\+\_\+height} The latest height in the blockchain that can not be reorganized (i.\+e. is backed by at least 2 Service Node, or 1 hardcoded checkpoint, 0 if N/A). Omitted if it cannot be determined (typically because the node is still syncing).
\item {\ttfamily pulse} will be true if the next expected block is a pulse block, false otherwise.
\item {\ttfamily pulse\+\_\+ideal\+\_\+timestamp} For pulse blocks this is the ideal timestamp of the next block, that is, the timestamp if the network was operating with perfect 2-\/minute blocks since the pulse hard fork.
\item {\ttfamily pulse\+\_\+target\+\_\+timestamp} For pulse blocks this is the target timestamp of the next block, which targets 2 minutes after the previous block but will be slightly faster/slower if the previous block is behind/ahead of the ideal timestamp.
\item {\ttfamily difficulty} Network mining difficulty; omitted when the network is expecting a pulse block.
\item {\ttfamily target} Current target for next proof of work.
\item {\ttfamily tx\+\_\+count} Total number of non-\/coinbase transaction in the chain.
\item {\ttfamily tx\+\_\+pool\+\_\+size} Number of transactions that have been broadcast but not included in a block.
\item {\ttfamily mainnet} Indicates whether the node is on the main network ({\ttfamily true}) or not ({\ttfamily false}).
\item {\ttfamily testnet} Indicates that the node is on the test network ({\ttfamily true}). Will be omitted for non-\/testnet.
\item {\ttfamily devnet} Indicates that the node is on the dev network ({\ttfamily true}). Will be omitted for non-\/devnet.
\item {\ttfamily fakechain} States that the node is running in \char`\"{}fakechain\char`\"{} mode ({\ttfamily true}). Omitted otherwise.
\item {\ttfamily nettype} String value of the network type (mainnet, testnet, devnet, or fakechain).
\item {\ttfamily top\+\_\+block\+\_\+hash} Hash of the highest block in the chain. Will be hex for J\+S\+ON requests, 32-\/byte binary value for bt requests.
\item {\ttfamily immutable\+\_\+block\+\_\+hash} Hash of the highest block in the chain that can not be reorganized. Hex string for json, bytes for bt.
\item {\ttfamily cumulative\+\_\+difficulty} Cumulative difficulty of all blocks in the blockchain.
\item {\ttfamily block\+\_\+size\+\_\+limit} Maximum allowed block size.
\item {\ttfamily block\+\_\+size\+\_\+median} Median block size of latest 100 blocks.
\item {\ttfamily ons\+\_\+counts} O\+NS registration counts, as a three-\/element list\+: \mbox{[}session, wallet, lokinet\mbox{]}
\item {\ttfamily offline} Indicates that the node is offline, if true. Omitted for online nodes.
\item {\ttfamily database\+\_\+size} Current size of \mbox{\hyperlink{classcryptonote_1_1Blockchain}{Blockchain}} data. Over public R\+PC this is rounded up to the next-\/largest GB value.
\item {\ttfamily version} Current version of this daemon, as a string. For a public node this will just be the major and minor version (e.\+g. \char`\"{}9\char`\"{}); for an admin rpc endpoint this will return the full version (e.\+g. \char`\"{}9.\+2.\+1\char`\"{}).
\item {\ttfamily status\+\_\+line} A short one-\/line summary string of the node (requires an admin/unrestricted connection for most details)
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the endpoint is a restricted (i.\+e. admin) endpoint then the following fields are also included\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily alt\+\_\+blocks\+\_\+count} Number of alternative blocks to main chain.
\item {\ttfamily outgoing\+\_\+connections\+\_\+count} Number of peers that you are connected to and getting information from.
\item {\ttfamily incoming\+\_\+connections\+\_\+count} Number of peers connected to and pulling from your node.
\item {\ttfamily white\+\_\+peerlist\+\_\+size} White Peerlist Size
\item {\ttfamily grey\+\_\+peerlist\+\_\+size} Grey Peerlist Size
\item {\ttfamily service\+\_\+node} Will be true if the node is running in --service-\/node mode.
\item {\ttfamily start\+\_\+time} Start time of the daemon, as U\+N\+IX time.
\item {\ttfamily last\+\_\+storage\+\_\+server\+\_\+ping} Last ping time of the storage server (0 if never or not running as a service node)
\item {\ttfamily last\+\_\+lokinet\+\_\+ping} Last ping time of lokinet (0 if never or not running as a service node)
\item {\ttfamily free\+\_\+space} Available disk space on the node. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
