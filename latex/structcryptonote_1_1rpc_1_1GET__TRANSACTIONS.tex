\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Look up one or more transactions by hash.

Outputs\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily status} -- Generic R\+PC error code. \char`\"{}\+O\+K\char`\"{} is the success value.
\item {\ttfamily missed\+\_\+tx} -- set of transaction hashes that were not found. If all were found then this field is omitted. There is no particular ordering of hashes in this list.
\item {\ttfamily txs} -- list of transaction details; each element is a dict containing\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily tx\+\_\+hash} -- Transaction hash.
\item {\ttfamily size} -- Size of the transaction, in bytes. Note that if the transaction has been pruned this is the post-\/pruning size, not the original size.
\item {\ttfamily in\+\_\+pool} -- Will be set to true if the transaction is in the transaction pool ({\ttfamily true}) and omitted if mined into a block.
\item {\ttfamily blink} -- True if this is an approved, blink transaction; this information is generally only available for approved in-\/pool transactions and txes in very recent blocks.
\item {\ttfamily fee} -- the transaction fee (in atomic O\+X\+EN) incurred in this transaction (not including any burned amount).
\item {\ttfamily burned} -- the amount of O\+X\+EN (in atomic units) burned by this transaction.
\item {\ttfamily block\+\_\+height} -- Block height including the transaction. Omitted for tx pool transactions.
\item {\ttfamily block\+\_\+timestamp} -- Unix time at which the block has been added to the blockchain. Omitted for tx pool transactions.
\item {\ttfamily output\+\_\+indices} -- List of transaction indexes. Omitted for tx pool transactions.
\item {\ttfamily relayed} -- For {\ttfamily in\+\_\+pool} transactions this field will be set to indicate whether the transaction has been relayed to the network.
\item {\ttfamily double\+\_\+spend\+\_\+seen} -- Will be set to true for tx pool transactions that are double-\/spends (and thus cannot be added to the blockchain). Omitted for mined transactions.
\item {\ttfamily received\+\_\+timestamp} -- Timestamp transaction was received in the pool. Omitted for mined blocks.
\item {\ttfamily max\+\_\+used\+\_\+block} -- the hash of the highest block referenced by this transaction; only for mempool transactions.
\item {\ttfamily max\+\_\+used\+\_\+height} -- the height of the highest block referenced by this transaction; only for mempool transactions.
\item {\ttfamily last\+\_\+failed\+\_\+block} -- the hash of the last block where this transaction was attempted to be mined (but failed).
\item {\ttfamily max\+\_\+used\+\_\+height} -- the height of the last block where this transaction failed to be acceptable for a block.
\item {\ttfamily weight} -- the transaction \char`\"{}weight\char`\"{} which is the size of the transaction with padding removed. Only included for mempool transactions (for mined transactions the size and weight at the same and so only {\ttfamily size} is included).
\item {\ttfamily kept\+\_\+by\+\_\+block} will be present and true if this is a mempool transaction that was added to the mempool after being popped off a block (e.\+g. because of a blockchain reorganization).
\item {\ttfamily last\+\_\+relayed\+\_\+time} indicates the last time this block was relayed to the network; only for mempool transactions.
\item {\ttfamily do\+\_\+not\+\_\+relay} -- set to true for mempool blocks that are marked \char`\"{}do not relay\char`\"{}
\item {\ttfamily double\+\_\+spend\+\_\+seen} -- set to true if one or more outputs in this mempool transaction have already been spent (and thus the tx cannot currently be added to the blockchain).
\item {\ttfamily data} -- Full, unpruned transaction data. For a json request this is hex-\/encoded; for a bt-\/encoded request this is raw bytes. This field is omitted if any of {\ttfamily decode\+\_\+as\+\_\+json}, {\ttfamily split}, or {\ttfamily prune} is requested; or if the transaction has been pruned in the database.
\item {\ttfamily pruned} -- The non-\/prunable part of the transaction, encoded as hex (for json requests). Always included if {\ttfamily split} or {\ttfamily prune} are specified; without those options it will be included instead of {\ttfamily data} if the transaction has been pruned.
\item {\ttfamily prunable} -- The prunable part of the transaction. Only included when {\ttfamily split} is specified, the transaction is prunable, and the tx has not been pruned from the database.
\item {\ttfamily prunable\+\_\+hash} -- The hash of the prunable part of the transaction. Will be provided if either\+: the tx has been pruned; or the tx is prunable and either of {\ttfamily prune} or {\ttfamily split} are specified.
\item {\ttfamily extra} -- Parsed \char`\"{}extra\char`\"{} transaction information; omitted unless specifically requested (via the {\ttfamily tx\+\_\+extra} request parameter). This is a dict containing one or more of the following keys.

\item {\ttfamily sn\+\_\+contributor} -- Service node contributor wallet address (for stakes)
\item {\ttfamily tx\+\_\+secret\+\_\+key} -- The transaction secret key, included in registrations/stakes to decrypt transaction amounts and recipients
\item {\ttfamily locked\+\_\+key\+\_\+images} -- Key image(s) locked by the transaction (for registrations, stakes)
\item {\ttfamily key\+\_\+image\+\_\+unlock} -- A key image being unlocked in a stake unlock request (an unlock will be started for {\itshape all} key images locked in the same SN contributions).
\item {\ttfamily sn\+\_\+registration} -- Service node registration details; this is a dict containing\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily fee} the operator fee expressed in millionths (i.\+e. 234567 == 23.\+4567\%)
\item {\ttfamily expiry} the unix timestamp at which the registration signature expires
\item {\ttfamily contributors\+:} dict of (wallet =$>$ portion) pairs indicating the staking portions reserved for the operator and any reserved contribution spots in the registration. Portion is expressed in millionths (i.\+e. 250000 = 25\% staking portion).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily sn\+\_\+state\+\_\+change} -- Information for a \char`\"{}state change\char`\"{} transaction such as a deregistration, decommission, recommission, or ip change reset transaction. This is a dict containing\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily old\+\_\+dereg} will be set to true if this is an \char`\"{}old\char`\"{} deregistration transaction (before the Loki 4 hardfork), omitted for more modern state change txes.
\item {\ttfamily type} string indicating the state change type\+: \char`\"{}dereg\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}decomm\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}recomm\char`\"{}, or \char`\"{}ip\char`\"{} for a deregistration, decommission, recommission, or ip change penalty transaction.
\item {\ttfamily height} the voting block height for the changing service node and voting service nodes that produced this state change transaction.
\item {\ttfamily index} the position of the affected node in the random list of tested nodes for this {\ttfamily height}.
