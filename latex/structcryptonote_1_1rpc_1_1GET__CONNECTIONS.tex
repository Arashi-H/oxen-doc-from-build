\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Retrieve information about incoming and outgoing P2P connections to your node.

Inputs\+: none

Output values available from a public R\+PC endpoint\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily status} General R\+PC status string. {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+O\+K\char`\"{}} means everything looks good.
\item {\ttfamily connections} List of all connections and their info; each element is a dict containing\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily incoming} bool of whether this connection was established by the remote to us (true) or by us to the remove (false).
\item {\ttfamily ip} address of the remote peer
\item {\ttfamily port} the remote port of the peer connection
\item {\ttfamily address\+\_\+type} -\/ 1/2/3/4 for ipv4/ipv6/i2p/tor, respectively.
\item {\ttfamily peer\+\_\+id} a string that uniquely identifies a peer node
\item {\ttfamily recv\+\_\+count} number of bytes of data received from this peer
\item {\ttfamily recv\+\_\+idle\+\_\+ms} number of milliseconds since we last received data from this peer
\item {\ttfamily send\+\_\+count} number of bytes of data send to this peer
\item {\ttfamily send\+\_\+idle\+\_\+ms} number of milliseconds since we last sent data to this peer
\item {\ttfamily state} returns the current state of the connection with this peer as a string, one of\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily before\+\_\+handshake} -\/ the connection is still being established/negotiated
\item {\ttfamily synchronizing} -\/ we are synchronizing the blockchain with this peer
\item {\ttfamily standby} -\/ the peer is available for synchronizing but we are not currently using it
\item {\ttfamily normal} -\/ this is a regular, synchronized peer
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily live\+\_\+ms} -\/ number of milliseconds since this connection was initiated
\item {\ttfamily avg\+\_\+download} -\/ the average download speed from this peer in bytes per second
\item {\ttfamily current\+\_\+download} -\/ the current (i.\+e. average over a very recent period) download speed from this peer in bytes per second.
\item {\ttfamily avg\+\_\+upload} -\/ the average upload speed to this peer in bytes per second
\item {\ttfamily current\+\_\+upload} -\/ the current upload speed to this peer in bytes per second
\item {\ttfamily connection\+\_\+id} -\/ a unique random string identifying this connection
\item {\ttfamily height} -\/ the height of the peer
\item {\ttfamily host} -\/ the hostname for this peer; only included if != {\ttfamily ip} 
\item {\ttfamily localhost} -\/ set to true if the peer is a localhost connection; omitted otherwise.
\item {\ttfamily local\+\_\+ip} -\/ set to true if the peer is a non-\/public, local network connection; omitted otherwise.
